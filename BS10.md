## Exercise 1 (comprehension)

#### 1. Name an advantage of a command line over a graphical user interface

- Faster to use (with bit of skill), no navigation and clicking
- Does not need GUI graphics to be handled, lighter

#### 2. What’s the distinction between a shell and a terminal?

- **Shell**: The actual program, that handels interpreting and executing commands, it takes care of interaction, loops, scripts, env variables.
- **Terminal**: The visible part, used to enter commands, hands them to shell, displays output.

#### 3. Name three standard formats other than Unicode for character encoding

ASCII, Windows-1250, Mac OS Roman

#### 4. Seeing as they are part of Unicode characters, can you put an Emoji in a web URL or an email address?

- In general: No, URLs and Mail use mostly ASCII encoding, which does not support emojis
- That is because their protocols, DNS and SMTP, are from a long time ago
- Workarounds: Punycode for URL (encodes emojis as ascii)
- SMTPUTF8 for Mail (not widely supported)

#### 5. What is the difference between a Desktop Environment and a Window Manager?

The Desktop Environment is the complete aggregation of software that provides the user with a GUI. It contains things like a file manager, launchers for applications, a tool for system settings and so on (examples are KDE Plasma, GNOME etc.). A Desktop Environment also includes a Window Manager, that handles just the placement, appearance etc. for windows.

- **DE**: Complete set of software, that provides the user with a GUI. It contains a file manager, launchers for applications, a tool for system settings etc.
- **WM**: A DE also contains a Window Manager, that handles just the placement, appearance etc. for windows. So it is a part

#### 6. What is the core difference between the X Window System and Wayland?

- **X**: Older, only provides the display server, that handles drawing on the actual display. Does not contain a window manager
- **Wayland**: Comes with the display server and the window manager

#### 7. Research and briefly describe how a stack canary can protect against buffer overflows

- For a function call, the return address sits at the top of the stackframe (assuming it grows downwards)
- After that: Canary and Buffer
- Buffer overflow (in our example upwards) can overwrite return address, changing the course of program execution
- But: If the return address is overwritten, so is the canary
- So on return, check canary, if correct continue, if not abort.

#### 8. What is authentication and how does it differ from authorization?

- **Authentication**: Process of veryfing who somebody is and confirming their identity (login)
- **Authorization**: Checking if somebody has the permission to do something


## Exercise 2 (Access Matrices)

Alice and Bob with different permissions for files x,y,z

#### 1. Specify access control lists for this situation.

ACLs store the sparse columns of the Access Matrix, so a list for each file:

- **x:** Alice: r, w ; Bob: r
- **y:** Alice: r ; Bob: r, w
- **z:** Alice: ex

#### 2. Specify capability lists for this situation.

C-Lists store the sparse rows of the Access Matrix, so a list for each user:

- **Alice:** x: r, w ; y: r ; z: ex
- **Bob:** x: r ; y: r, w

#### 3. How do access control lists and capability lists differ when revoking all permissions for a file?

- ACLs store permissions per file, so taking all permissions for a file away just means deleting/emptying its ACL
- C-Lists store permissions per user, so iterate over every user and delete that files permissions

#### 4. How do access control lists and capability lists differ when revoking all privileges for a user?

- Other way round, ACL has to iterate over every file and delete users permissions
- C-List can just be deleted/emptied for that user


## Exercise 3 (Shell Exploits)

We have access to an executable with the suid bit set that is owned by root. We want to describe a possible attack using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH flag.

#### 1. How can that be abused?

- With suid bit set and root as owner, the executable will run with root permissions
- If it uses shared libraries that are dynamically linked, it will run those at runtime
- LD_LIBRARY_PATH tells the dynamic linker where to look for those first
- An attacker could, in a directory they own, create a shared library named like one used by the executable and set that dir as LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- The dynamic linker then loads that malicious version instead of the correct one
- The attackers code is then executed with root permissions

Policy to combat that:
- Ignore LD_LIBRARY_PATH flag for any suid programs


#### 2. Shell Exploit Race Condition

With how an OS handles shell script execution, a race condition can be used for an exploit.

- There is a small window of time between the kernel closing the file after noticing it is a script and it opening the shell interpreter with the executable as an argument
- With write access to the directory, in that small window, an attacker can replace the executable with their own version (that is the race condition)
- The shell interpreter might then end up executing the malicious version
- Problem: That bypasses any security checks that might have been done before execution


## Exercise 4 (password security)

An attacker has a database of hashed passwords and now wants to generate all possible passwords to find the one corresponding to a hash.

#### 1. How long does it take on average to find a password for a present hash value?

We have 8 GPUs with 32 GibiHashes per second each, so:

8 * 32 GiH/s = 256 GiH/s = 256 * 2^30 H/s can be calculated

==> What to do for each of these cases: Calculate the number of possible passwords, divide by the number of generated hashed per second for worst case, divide by 2 for the average case.

##### a: 8 characters long, using only lowercase letters

26^8 = 208827064576 possible passwords, so worst-case: 208827064576 / (256 * 2^30) = 0.76 seconds. Average case: 0.76 / 2 = 0.38 seconds

##### b: 8 characters long, using lowercase letters, uppercase letters and digits

(26 + 26 + 10)^8 = 62^8 possible passwords, so worst-case: 62^8 / (256 * 2^30) = 794 seconds. Average case: 794 / 2 = 397 seconds = 6.6 minutes

##### c: 12 characters long, using only lowercase letters

26^12 possible passwords, so worst-case: 26^12 / (256 * 2^30) = 347169 seconds. Average case: 173584.5 seconds = 48.2 hours

##### d: 12 characters long, using lowercase letters, uppercase letters and digits

(26 + 26 + 10)^12 = 62^12 possible passwords, so worst-case 62^12 / (256 * 2^30) = 11737090107.6 seconds. Average case: 5868545053.81 seconds = 186.1 years

#### 2. For non random PWs the average time can be reduced, why

As passwords are often chosen by humans, there are multiple ways to use their predictable behaviour to reduce average time:

- Use precomputed dictionarys of commong passwords/common parts of passwords (real words etc.)
- Combine that with rules (a lot of passwords start with an uppercase letter, then lowercase, then number, then symbol etc.)

With approaches like that, one is very likely to reduce the average time (not the worst-case for actual, strong passwords).


### Programming exercise 6

### 1. Is there any plain fault in the logic?

While checking passwords (correct and wrong ones) works fine, using strcpy on a fixed sized buffer without bounds checking means, that input strings that are larger are just copied into adjacent memory regions. With protections on, this could still corrupt memory. For even longer inputs, the program crashes with stack smashing detected. But the general logic works fine.

### 2. Can you find an invalid password that allows for successful authentication?

Yes, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (or most other strings between 29-31 bytes, for example äääääääääääääää)

### 3. What can you do to fix the vulnerability?

One can make sure, that strcpy does not copy more than the fixed size buffer can take. Using strncpy instead lets one define how many characters of a string should be copied. That way, a buffer overflow can no longer happen (input passwords just get cut off). See code for implementation. If a fixed size buffer (or a buffer in general) can be avoided, that works as well.
